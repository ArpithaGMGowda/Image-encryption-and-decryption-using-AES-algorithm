# Image-encryption-and-decryption-using-AES-algorithm

Image Encryption is important because it allows you to securely protect data that you don’t want anyone else to have access to. As the importance and the value of digital information exchange over the Internet or other media types are increasing, the search for the best solution to offer the necessary protection against the data attacks.

Image Decryption is used to reverse the process of Encryption. In this process the image which is encrypted is then decrypted to get the normal form of the Image.

Today, lot of images are used as a digital signature for many of the services and their security is very essential, hence through this interface we provide a way to encrypt the image at source as well as compress it. The same is also decrypted and decompressed at the destination. Users see the confidentiality in AES Algorithm used for encryption.

**Functional Requirements:-**

•	Functional requirements directly support the user requirements by describing the processing of the information as inputs or outputs.

•	The application must be able to recognize and handling all the image file types. Example - JPG, JPEG, PNG.

•	The system must be able to ask user to input Passwords for encryption process.

•	Should be able to save the password hash into the image while encryption process take place and retrieve it back once in decryption process.

•	Image file sizes should not be significantly affected to prevent doubt for the unauthorized user.

•	Image should be transmitted according to user preference safely after being encrypted.

**Non-Functional Requirements:-**

•	Non-functional requirements cover all the remaining requirements which are not covered by the functional requirements. They specify criteria that judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behavior.

•	Performance

Performance requirement reference to as measurement of some output or behavior in a system. The process performance is being evaluated according to time taken for encryption and decryption of image process take place.

•	Security

Security requirement in this project refer to as the inability of unauthorized user or intruder to read Images that are being transmitted between sender and receiver.This is crucial requirement for the project.
